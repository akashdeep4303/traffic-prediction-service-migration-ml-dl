## 📌 Project Highlights

🔍 **Problem Statement**  
Modern distributed systems often face unpredictable traffic. This project aims to:
- **Predict traffic patterns** using time-series ML/DL models.
- Enable **intelligent service migration** to reduce latency and improve availability.

🧠 **Solution Overview**
- **LSTM** and **ARIMA** models used for accurate traffic prediction.
- **Reinforcement Learning** logic for deciding service placement dynamically.

📊 **Achievements**
- 🚀 ~85% prediction accuracy
- 🧠 Up to **25% latency reduction**
- 🕒 Real-time adaptable system using ML/DL at scale
